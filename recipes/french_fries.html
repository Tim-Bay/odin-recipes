    <h2>Homemade French fries from russet potatoes!</h2>
    <p>These are easy to make ahead of time and fry or bake in the oven for a quick snack or side dish idea!</p>

    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>Russet potatoes are ideal. Since they’re dense, they don’t contain as much water inside, which allows them to get extra crispy.</li>
        <li>Waxy potatoes are the worst. These include red potatoes, fingerling, and new potatoes. They’re high in moisture, and will actually become hollow when fried as the water evaporates out.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li> Slice the potatoes 1/2 inch thick.</li>
        <li>Soak them cold in water for at least an hour or overnight.</li>
        <li>Rinse them twice with cold water and pat the completely dry.</li>
        <li>Heat oil to 300 degrees. Fry them in about 6 batches for 5-6 minutes.</li>
        <li>Increase heat to 400 degrees. Fry in batches until golden brown, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Place them on paper towels and sprinkle immediately with salt. Serve with ketchup!</li>
    </ol>
